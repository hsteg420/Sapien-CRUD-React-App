# Getting Started with CRUD React App

A React App where the user should be able to add, edit, delete or view(CRUD) the clients in the table. The user can create, edit, view and delete the leads from the table. When a new client is added, open a modal where he can fill the form and submit.

### Fake Json Server

Simple fake json server for GET, POST only. Each api call only returns json data. It fits if you simply verify your api call works with return value.

### concurrently

Run multiple commands concurrently. Like npm run watch-js & npm run watch-less but better.
